# bunhexdump
Simple hexdump-like program I wrote out of boredom.

Just run make to compile it, only uses standard C++ libraries. Requires C++11.

# Usage
Usage: bunhexdump [-n/--names][-h/--help] files(...)
  * -h/--help: display help and usage info
  * -n/--names: Display file names before dumping data

Supports multiple files, should you want that.
